This is the portion of a [group project](https://github.com/ngocanh2809/CS5446-Bipedal-Walker) done by me. 

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/BatmanofZuhandArrgh/BipedalWalker-ModifiedReward.git
cd BipedalWalker-ModifiedReward
```

Install an appropriate version of pytorch, then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
